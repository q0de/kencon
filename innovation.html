          <h2>KSP Lock Innovation</h2>
          <img src="images/dummy.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>
          Problem; Expandable RV’s with fold out bed doors – Locks are too high off the 

ground for most RV owners to reach safely. Many must use step ladders or other 

unsafe measures to work latches. Also, water leaks due to non-adjustable nature 

of competitors latches.</p>

<p>Solution; KSP’s RotoVise Lock System. With the RotoVise locks, the clamping 

feature is near the top of the door where it needs to be to discourage water leaks. 

However, for the first time, the operator handle actuator is at the bottom of 

the door where it is easily reached. The RotoVise clamps the door shut with less 

effort on the operators part than other locks, and can be adjusted by your dealer 

should you need more clamping force in the future. The RotoVise incorporates 

a built in locking feature for security. The RotoVise is constructed of automotive 

grade “Super Tough” reinforced thermoplastics with aluminum and stainless steel 

hardware for corrosion resistance. RotoVise Locks – for stress-free camping!</p>
